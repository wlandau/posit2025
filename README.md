# R-multiverse: a next-generation dual repository built on R-universe

R-multiverse is a new dual repository and a home for R packages outside the scope of CRAN/Bioconductor.
Each package is registered once, and then maintainers directly control releases through GitHub/GitLab.
R-multiverse hosts a Community repository with the latest release of each package, and a Production repository with quarterly snapshots of the releases from Community that pass automated checks.
Built on R-universe and GitHub, R-multiverse is mostly automated.
R-multiverse originated from the R Consortium Repositories Working Group, it has transparent governance, and it operates in a collaborative and open way.
It is not mature or established yet, but it is under active development, and it is ready for package contributions.
